# Girls Night HQ — girls-night planning site (income engine #2)

A reader-supported content + tool site in the **girls night / party planning** niche. Same money model as
Cozylore, deliberately a different look (glam "night" vibe — deep plum, hot-pink→purple gradients, gold, sparkle).
It makes money two ways, with **no store and no products to ship**:

1. **Display ads** (Google AdSense → later Ezoic/Mediavine as traffic grows)
2. **Affiliate links** (Amazon Associates, tag `cozylore-21` — commission when a reader buys)

Traffic comes from **Google SEO** (slow, compounding) **+ Pinterest** (fast — reuses the same publishing engine
as Cozylore; this niche is huge on Pinterest).

It lives entirely in `/girlsnight/` so it never touches the root `index.html` (HeaddR Wallpapers) or `/cozy/`.

## ✨ The hook: the "Build your night" tool

The homepage isn't just a blog — it's an interactive planner (gamified):

- 6 category tiles: **Games, Drinks, Snacks, Deko & Themes, Pamper & Spa, Movie Night**.
- Each tile has curated **+ Add** picks (Amazon affiliate searches).
- A **progress tracker (x/6)** fills as the user plans more categories.
- Everything added lands in **"My Night"** — a shopping list with affiliate links, *Copy list* and *Clear all*.
- 100% static: pure JS + `localStorage`, no backend, no tracking. See `app.js`.

To add/adjust categories or picks, edit the `CATEGORIES` array at the top of `girlsnight/app.js`.

## ✅ What YOU need to add (one-time setup)

| # | Account | Why | Cost | Where it plugs in |
|---|---------|-----|------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Amazon Associates** | Commission on linked products | Free | Tag `cozylore-21` is already wired into `app.js` + every `.pick` box. Swap the tag if you want a separate one. |
| 2 | **Google AdSense** | Display ads = passive income | Free | Loader tag already in `<head>` (pub-4473022510510415); the `.ad-slot` divs are where ads show. |
| 3 | **beehiiv** (or MailerLite) | Newsletter list | Free tier | Replace `action="#"` on each `<form>` (search `NEWSLETTER`). |
| 4 | **Pinterest** (already have one!) | Free traffic from day one | Free | Pins auto-publish from `girlsnight/pins/queue.json` via the shared Action. Optional: set a separate board with the `PINTEREST_BOARD_ID_GIRLSNIGHT` secret. |
| 5 | *(later)* **Google Search Console** | See rankings | Free | Verify the domain once. |

## 🔌 Exact spots to edit

- **Affiliate tag:** `AFF_TAG` in `app.js`, and `tag=cozylore-21` in the post `.pick` boxes (search `AFFILIATE`).
- **AdSense:** already loaded; ads fill the `.ad-slot` divs once approved.
- **Newsletter:** search `NEWSLETTER` — replace the form `action`.
- **Categories / picks:** the `CATEGORIES` array in `app.js`.

## 🔁 How the content engine runs (recurring, see CONTENT-ENGINE.md)

Each cycle: pick the top unpublished topic from the backlog below, write a full SEO article into
`girlsnight/posts/` using an existing post as the template, link it from the homepage guides grid and related
posts, add a pin to `girlsnight/pins/queue.json`, commit & push. Never touch the root `index.html` or `/cozy/`.

## ⏱️ Honest expectations

- Months 1–3: build the library (15–25 articles), Pinterest brings the first trickle (this niche pins extremely well).
- Months 4–6: Google starts trusting the site; first steady ad + affiliate income. The interactive planner is a
  retention/affiliate-click advantage Cozylore doesn't have.
- Low-touch, not zero-touch: ~1 hour/month from you (payouts, account health, direction).
